# ChessGame Engine


## Overview
A chess game engine built with **Python**, **Pygame**, and **NumPy**.  
Play chess with a graphical interface and extend it with a custom AI to evaluate and checking valid and best move possible.
This is my project since I am passionate about Machine Learning as well as Chess.
