# ChessGame


## Overview
A simple chess engine built with **Python**, **Pygame**, and **NumPy**.  
Play chess with a graphical interface and extend it with a custom AI to evaluate and checking valid and best move possible.
This is my project since I am passionate about Machine Learning as well as Chess.

## Features
- 8×8 chessboard rendered with **Pygame**
- Pieces represented with NumPy for fast AI logic
- Standard chess setup with white and black pieces
- Modular design: separate
